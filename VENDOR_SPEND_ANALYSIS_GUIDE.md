---

## 🔍 Phase 3: Quality Assessment (Days 6-7)

### 3.1 Data Profiling Checklist

Run these checks on your dataset:

**Completeness Checks:**

- [ ] Supplier ID: >95% populated
- [ ] Amount: 100% populated, no zeros
- [ ] Currency: 100% populated
- [ ] Date: 100% populated, valid range
- [ ] Description: >90% populated

**Consistency Checks:**

---

## 🧹 Phase 4: Data Cleansing (Days 7-8)

### 4.1 Vendor Name Standardization

**Common Issues & Fixes:**

| Issue | Example | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Abbreviations | IBM vs I.B.M. | Standardize to legal name |
| Subsidiaries | Microsoft Corp vs Microsoft Azure | Group under parent |
| Typos | Amazn vs Amazon | Correct spelling |
| Special Characters | AT&T vs AT and T | Consistent format |
| Case Issues | amazon vs AMAZON | Proper case |

**Standardization Process:**
1. Export unique vendor list
2. Create mapping table (old name → standard name)
3. Apply mapping to all transactions
4. Validate no orphan records

### 4.2 Amount Normalization

**Currency Conversion:**
```
USD_Amount = Original_Amount * Exchange_Rate
```

Use month-end rates for consistency:
- Source: Corporate finance or xe.com
- Document rates used
- Keep original currency for audit

**Handling Credits/Returns:**
- Separate field for transaction type
- Net amount calculation
- Flag unusual patterns

### 4.3 Description Enhancement

**Cleaning Steps:**
1. Remove special characters (!@#$%)
2. Expand abbreviations (qty → quantity)
3. Standardize units (pc, pcs, piece → pieces)
4. Remove vendor names from descriptions
5. Trim excessive spaces

**Before:** "DELL##LAPTOP--Latitude5520;QTY:5PCS!!!"
**After:** "Laptop Latitude 5520 Quantity 5 Pieces"

---

## 🏷️ Phase 5: Categorization (Days 9-13) - CRITICAL

### 5.1 Five-Level Taxonomy Structure

**This is the MINIMUM categorization required for meaningful analysis:**

#### Level 1: Major Category (10-15 categories)
```
- IT & Telecom
- Professional Services  
- Facilities & Maintenance
- Marketing & Advertising
- Travel & Entertainment
- HR Services
- Logistics & Transportation
- Raw Materials
- Office Supplies
- Utilities
```

#### Level 2: Category (40-50 categories)
```
IT & Telecom →
  - Hardware
  - Software
  - Cloud Services
  - Telecom Services
  - IT Services
```

#### Level 3: Subcategory (150-200 categories)
```
Hardware →
  - Computers & Laptops
  - Servers & Storage
  - Networking Equipment
  - Peripherals
  - Mobile Devices
```

#### Level 4: Product Type (500-800 categories)
```

```

### 5.2 Categorization Rules

**Minimum Coverage Requirements:**
- Level 1: 100% of spend
- Level 2: 100% of spend
- Level 3: 95% of spend
- Level 4: 80% of spend (top vendors)
- Level 5: 60% of spend (strategic categories)

### 5.3 Categorization Process

**Step 1: Automated Categorization (60-70% accuracy)**
```python
# Keyword-based rules
if 'laptop' in description.lower():
    category = 'IT & Telecom > Hardware > Computers & Laptops > Laptop Computers'
elif 'consulting' in description.lower():
    category = 'Professional Services > Consulting > Management Consulting'
```

**Step 2: Vendor-Based Categorization**
- Map known vendors to categories
- Example: Microsoft → Software
- Maintains consistency

**Step 3: Manual Review (Top 80% of spend)**
- Sort by spend amount descending
- Review until 80% coverage
- Document decisions

**Step 4: Machine Learning (Optional)**
- Train on completed categorization
- Apply to remaining 20%
- Manual spot checks

### 5.4 Quality Metrics

**Minimum Acceptable:**
- [ ] 100% Level 1 categorization
- [ ] 100% Level 2 categorization  
- [ ] 95% Level 3 categorization
- [ ] No "Uncategorized" in top 100 transactions
- [ ] Category distribution follows 80/20 rule

---

## 📊 Phase 6: Analysis & Insights (Days 14-16)

### 6.1 Spend Analysis Calculations

**Total Addressable Spend:**
```
Total Spend = Sum(All Transactions)
Addressable Spend = Total Spend - (Tax + Non-Influenceable)
Savings Potential = Addressable Spend × 15%
```

**Vendor Concentration:**
```
Top 10 Vendor % = (Top 10 Vendor Spend / Total Spend) × 100
Target: 40-60% (not too concentrated, not too fragmented)
```

**Category Distribution:**
```
Category % = (Category Spend / Total Spend) × 100
Identify if any category >30% (opportunity for deep dive)
```

### 6.2 Key Performance Indicators

Calculate these KPIs:

| KPI | Formula | Target | Action if Off-Target |
|-----|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Vendor Count | COUNT(Unique Vendors) | <500 | Consolidation opportunity |
| Avg Transaction | Total Spend / Transaction Count | >$1,000 | Process efficiency review |
| Contract Coverage | Contract Spend / Total Spend | >80% | Increase contract adoption |
| Maverick Spend | Non-PO Spend / Total Spend | <10% | Compliance improvement |
| Payment Terms | Avg Days Payable | 30-45 days | Optimize cash flow |

### 6.3 Opportunity Identification

**Savings Opportunities Matrix:**

| Opportunity Type | Identification Method | Typical Savings |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Vendor Consolidation | Multiple vendors, same category | 10-15% |
| Volume Discounts | Fragmented purchases | 5-10% |
| Contract Compliance | Off-contract spending | 15-20% |
| Specification Review | Over-specified products | 10-25% |
| Payment Terms | Early payment discounts | 1-2% |
| Demand Management | Reduce consumption | 5-15% |

### 6.4 Advanced Analytics

**Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule):**
1. Rank vendors by spend
2. Calculate cumulative percentage
3. Identify point where 80% spend reached
4. Focus on these strategic vendors

**Price Variance Analysis:**
```
Price Variance = (Current Price - Historical Avg) / Historical Avg × 100
Flag if variance >10%
```

**Trend Analysis:**
```
Monthly Growth = (Current Month - Previous Month) / Previous Month × 100
Flag if growth >20% month-over-month
```
